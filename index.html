HEADLINE

The future of domestic helpers lies in the shared responsibility of employers and agencies (proposed) / The dark side of recruitment agency culture (proposed) </p>
<br> 
<p style="font-size:150%; font-family:georgia;"> In 100 words, explain the story:</p>

es ( I want to see if there’s any astonishing fact) 
When many people are blaming the employers who disrespect or mistreat domestic helpers, the agencies themselves also have the responsibility. Should the agency take the responsibility to protect their rights? The recruitment agencies often charge the helpers more than thousands of dollars but fail to offer follow-up service or support. What’s more, they don’t give the helpers receipts back, if doing so, how could the payment be successfully recognised and settled?
